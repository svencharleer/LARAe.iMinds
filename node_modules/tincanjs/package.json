IE 6+ are\nsupported for non-CORS (because they don't support it).\n\nInclude *one* of build/tincan-min.js or build/tincan.js as follows:\n\n    <script src=\"build/tincan-min.js\"></script>\n\nNode.js Usage\n-------------\n\nTinCanJS is available via `npm`.\n\nThe `Environment/Node.js` wrapper used in this version has a dependency on the 'xhr2' module\nwhich is also available via `npm`. It is used to allow the interfaces to the underlying LRS\nrequests to have the same API. As such currently there is no support for synchronous requests\nwhen using this environment.\n\nInstall via:\n\n    npm install tincanjs\n\nAnd within code:\n\n    var TinCan = require('tincanjs');\n\nEnvironments\n------------\n\nImplementing a new Environment should be straightforward and requires overloading a couple\nof methods on the `TinCan.LRS` prototype. There are currently two examples, `Environment/Browser`\nand `Environment/Node`.\n",
